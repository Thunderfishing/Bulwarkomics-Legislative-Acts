Whereas New Crossroads seeks a skilled workforce and informal swirl post-revolution to boost trades and minimize surveillance; be it enacted:

---

## Section 1: Establishment and Objectives
- **Structure**: Mandatory service (18–20) and mentorship via 5,000 hubs (2075).
- **Boot Camp**: Males only (500K/year), funded by *Education Act* SWF ($750M/year), yields 600K “warlike” males (2055), $150B GDP boost (2075).
- **Objectives**: Train 1.2M journeymen, 600K mentors, integrate 7.5M immigrants, boost productivity ($50B), support 90% co-op ($13T), enhance informal ($537B).

---

## Section 2: National Service Program
- **Structure**: 2-year service for 5M—military ($1K/year bonus), civilian (trades, healthcare), informal ($4K/year + 2% shares, 500K).
- **Exemptions**: Parents ($2K), re-entry 30–40.
- **Output**: $28B/year infra, $100B informal (2075).

---

## Section 3: Master-Apprentice Framework
- **Structure**: 4M apprentices (500K informal), 1.2M journeymen, 600K masters ($5K bonus, 1% shares), 4,600 elders ($5K/year) by 2075.

---

## Section 4: Funding and Incentives
- **SWF**: $1B seed, 4% yield ($40M/year → $100M/year), funds $28B infra.
- **Incentives**: Service $4K/year ($8K), military $5K/year ($10K), informal $4K + 2% shares, FCL dividends $17B (2075).

---

## Section 5: Delivery and Integration
- **Infrastructure**: 5,000 hubs train 30K workers ($80K–$120K), $28B infra (30% rural).
- **Immigration**: 300K/year, 7.5M by 2075 ($15B value).

---

## Section 6: Governance and Oversight
- **Regional Boards**: Subcommittees oversee service, informal track.
- **Central Oversight**: Ensures 5% unemployment.

---

## Section 7: Implementation and Milestones
- **2025**: 4M (500K informal), $1.4B fund.
- **2030**: 960K journeymen, $14B infra, $360B informal.
- **2055**: 1.2M journeymen, $40B productivity, $480B informal.
- **2075**: 1.2M journeymen, $50B productivity, $537B informal.

## Notes
- **Informal**: 500K track adds $100B (2075).
- **Risks**: $100B tax loss offset by tariffs.
- **Synergy**: Ties to *Education Act* boot camp, *Monetary Act*’s $537B informal.
