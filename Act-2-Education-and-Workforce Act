## Preamble
New Crossroads wants education that’s debt-free, classical, and co-op-driven—boosting hustles, cutting surveillance, growing masters for life. Here’s the act:

---

## Section 1: The Setup
- **Structure**: Universal education (ages 5–20) via co-op schools and 5,000 hubs (Monetary Act)—16.8M students (2075).  
- **Boot Camp**: Males only, 500K/year—90 days of weapons, fitness, discipline ($750M/year).  
- **Goals**: Educate 16.8M, erase $2T student debt (2025), train 1.2M journeymen, grow co-op dividends, feed informal trade.

---

## Section 2: Curriculum & Structure
- **Phases**:  
  - **5–11**: Core—classical trivium (grammar, logic, rhetoric), math, amor amoris (order of affections).  
  - **12–15**: Fiscal literacy, co-op basics—$200/student venture loans (credit unions).  
  - **16–18**: Logic, trades—vocational or professional tracks.  
  - **18–20**: Service—500K informal, ties to Workforce Act.  
- **Master-Apprentice**: Lifelong—4M apprentices, 1.2M journeymen, 600K masters (2075). Masters get 2% co-op dividends per apprentice (5% grand masters, 10+ apprentices)—covers trades and professions.  
- **Why**: Classical roots, co-op hustle—lifelong learning, not debt.

---

## Section 3: Funding & Vouchers
- **SWF**: $1B seed, 4% yield—$40M/year (2025) to $100M/year (2075)—funds $45B budget ($750M boot camp, $44.25B vouchers).  
- **Vouchers**: $32K/student—$2K/year (5–17, $26K), $4K/year (18–20, $8K), informal gets $4K + 2% hub shares.  
- **Credit Union Loans**: $5B/year student ventures—$200/student, co-ops distribute, kids join credit unions early.  
- **Point**: Debt-free—SWF and loans feed the co-op ecosystem.

---

## Section 4: Delivery & Infrastructure
- **Schools/Hubs**: 1,000 co-op schools, 5,000 hubs—$40B SWF funds. 30K educators ($80K–$120K, 2075).  
- **Tech**: $400M/year—$200M broadband, $200M tools (ties to Communications Act).  
- **Vibe**: Local, classical—hubs push informal skills.

---

## Section 5: Workforce Integration
- **Link**: 4M/year service (500K informal)—feeds Workforce Act, Healthcare Act (20K healthcare, 10K mental health workers).  
- **Masters**: Co-op dividends—2% per apprentice, 5% grand masters—ties success to mentorship.  
- **Goal**: Co-op jobs, lifelong trades—vocational and professional.

---

## Section 6: Oversight
- **Regional Boards**: Subcommittees run vouchers, loans, informal skills—local say.  
- **Central Oversight**: Nevada Fortress Hub (Monetary Act)—enforces $2T debt cut, audits hubs.  
- **Why**: Co-ops lead, gov’s light.

---

## Section 7: Rollout
- **2025**: 5M students, $5B loans kick off.  
- **2030**: 10M—debt starts dropping.  
- **2055**: 15M—1M journeymen roll.  
- **2075**: 16.8M—1.2M journeymen, 600K masters.  
- **Aim**: Debt-free education, co-op scale.

---

## Notes
- **Synergy**: Ties to Monetary Act (5,000 hubs, $15B credits), Healthcare Act (jobs), Communications Act (tech).  
- **Core**: $1B SWF, $5B loans, $32K vouchers—proposal focus, no sim bloat.  
- **Next**: Sync with updated acts—master dividends to co-op GDP.
