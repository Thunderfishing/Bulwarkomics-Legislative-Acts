# Bulwarkomics Legislative Acts
Legislative framework for New Crossroads, a post-revolution nation (100M, $10T GDP, 2025 → 112M, $14.5T GDP, 2075), targeting $0 debt, $537B informal economy, and 90% co-op ownership by 2075.

This repository contains the core acts driving Bulwarkomics—a debt-free, co-operative economic system. Each act builds on a unified simulation, integrating dual currency, blockchain hubs, sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), tax reforms, and governance restructuring.

## Overview
- **Start**: 2025—100M population, $10T GDP (drops to $8T post-revolution), $13T debt.
- **End**: 2075—112M population, $14.5T GDP, $0 debt, $537B informal economy (30% of $1.79T local flow).
- **Goals**: Wipe $13T debt, boost informal economy to $537B, achieve 90% co-op ownership ($13T GDP share).
