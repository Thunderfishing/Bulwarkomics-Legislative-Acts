---

## Section 1: The Setup
- **Structure**: Member-owned co-ops via 5,000 hubs (Monetary Act)—targets 65M healthcare (58%) and 40M mental health (36%) of 112M by 2075.  
- **Goals**: Cover most folks, gut federal spending, save families $200 out-of-pocket, boost informal trade, cut mental health costs big.

  - Healthcare SWF: $500M seed, 4% yield—$30M/year (2075).  
  - Mental Health SWF: $300M seed, 4% yield—$18M/year (2075).  
- **FCL Hubs**: $400M/year (2075), $100M/year loans—co-op profits, no debt.  
- **Informal Credits**: $5B/year ($200/family)—from Monetary Act’s $15B credits pool.
