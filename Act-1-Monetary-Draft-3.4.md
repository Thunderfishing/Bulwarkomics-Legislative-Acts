Description: Proposes a debt-free, co-operative monetary system for New Crossroads, integrating dual currency, blockchain hubs, sector-specific SWFs, and a flat tax with targeted fees to erase national debt, grow informal trade, and shift ownership to co-ops by 2075.

## Preamble
Whereas New Crossroads demands a post-revolution economy that axes debt, trims federal waste, lifts co-ops and informal markets, and keeps prices honest with light oversight—here’s the blueprint:

## Section 1: Monetary System
### Dual Currency System
- **Metal-Infused Cash**: Polymer notes with gold/silver threads—mandatory for trades under $500, issued via hubs with 0.25% bonus on (non-programable) BWC-to-Cash swaps.  
- **Bulwark Coin (BWC)**: Blockchain currency (non-programable) for digital and global use—1.5% base fee on trades, 2% on crypto swaps, mandatory for state contracts.  
- **Purpose**: Fuel informal trade, sharpen global pricing.

### Co-op Blockchain Hub Network
- **Structure**: Thousands of hubs, some rural-locked—handle swaps (2% fee), micro-loans ($500 each,interest free), and trades (1.5% fee). Split profits: 50% to members, 50% reinvested.  
- **Rural Bonus**: $600/family via hubs—kickstart rural informal markets.  
- **Co-op Veto**: Co-op members vote via blockchain—75% approval to block amendments.  
- **Hub Voting**: Citizens vote through hubs—75% locks loans and swaps.  
- **Purpose**: Push local spending, aim for co-op control.

### Transaction Fee and Liquidity Pool
- **Fee**:Dynamic Federal fee, up to a additional 2% on BWC trades over $1M, 1.5% base on others—split 20% to hubs, 80% to priorities.  
- **Liquidity Pool**: Hubs pitch in 0.5% of fee income—half stays rural.  
- **Purpose**: Fund resilience, steer informal growth.

- **Purpose**: Show true inflation, align wages.

- **FCL Businesses** Any business can adopt Federated Co-operatives structure 70/30 Member Owners/Investors (vote cap 5%)
- **Anti-Co-op Repeal**: Kill laws blocking co-ops.  
- **Purpose**: Drive informal markets, aim for co-op GDP dominance.

## Section 4: Tax and Economic Reforms
- **Tax Elimination**: Drop federal income and property taxes—aid the bottom fifth.

- **Budget Cap**: Lock spending low—regions vote to bust it.

## Section 6: Implementation and Goals
