Description: Companion to Monetary Act Draft 4.0—details fee structures, triggers, hub oversight, audits, and fraud controls for New Crossroads’ debt-free, co-op system.

## Section 1: Fee Structure and Triggers
- **Base Fees**:  
  - 1.5% on all BWC trades—split 50% hubs, 50% SWFs.  
  - 2% on crypto swaps—20% hubs, 80% SWFs.  
  - 0.25% bonus on cash-to-BWC swaps—100% to informal traders.  
- **Dynamic Federal Fee**: Up to 2% on trades over $1M—replaces interest rate lever.  
  - **Triggers**:  
    - Inflation > 5% (CPI real costs)—cool hot sectors.  
    - Trade volume > 10% monthly GDP—curb speculation.  
    - Regional GDP drop > 3%—target relief zones.  
  - **Split**: 20% hubs, 80% SWFs (50% Rainy Day, 50% Emergency Liquidity).  
- **Purpose**: Fund SWFs, steer economy, boost resilience.

## Section 2: Hub Oversight
- **Fortress Hub**: Rural desert (Nevada-style)—central oversight base. Lean fission-powered, max-range AM transmitter, bullion repository (metal-infused cash reserve), small airbase (air force security). Hosts fraud talk radio—jokes, shit talk, call-ins on scams/threats.  
- **Regional Boards**: 20 boards (250 hubs each)—manage swaps, loans, votes.  
- **Random Audits**:  
  - Fortress: 5% of hubs yearly—blockchain sweeps, fee checks.  
  - Regional: 10% of hubs quarterly—verify swaps, $500 micro-loans.  
- **Purpose**: Fortress catches big fraud, regions handle local—AM ties rural in.

## Section 3: Credit Union Mechanics
- **Role**: Process all federal payments (grants, rebates), issue SWF loans, refund profits.  
- **Fraud Controls**:  
  - **Fortress Fraud Unit**: Audits 2% of credit unions yearly—BWC flags >5% loan defaults.  
  - **Random Audits**: 5% of transactions monthly—check $300/$600 credits, SWF loans.  
- **Purpose**: Bank-free co-op cash—Fortress scales trust.

## Section 4: Liquidity and Audits
- **Liquidity Pool**: 0.5% of hub fee income—50% rural-locked, 50% flexible.  
- **Random Audits**:  
  - 10% of pool quarterly—Fortress verifies rural split.  
  - Trigger: >3% discrepancy—full audit, funds seized.  
- **Purpose**: Keep emergency cash honest.

## Section 5: Special Auditors
- **Structure**: Fortress-based, $30M/year budget—replace prosecutors.  
- **Powers**:  
  - Audit 5% of hubs, credit unions, SWFs yearly.  
  - Seize illicit funds (RICO)—redistribute to Community SWF.  
  - Target 4% crime—BWC fraud, hub theft.  
- **Purpose**: Fast justice—dig, grab, skip courts.

## Section 6: FCL Business Rules
- **Structure**: 70% member-owned, 30% investors—5% max vote cap per investor.  
- **Adoption**: Any business (10+ members)—0% tax first 5 years (under 30 employees).  
- **Excess Profits**: 33% health, 5% education, 33% charity, 29% members (max $800 each).  
- **Purpose**: Grow co-ops, cap investor sway.

## Notes
- **Fortress Hub**: Central AM/fraud nexus—bullion backs cash, airbase guards it.
