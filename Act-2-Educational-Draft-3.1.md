- **Master-Apprentice**: 4M apprentices (500K informal), 1.2M journeymen, 600K masters (2075).

---

## Section 3: Funding and Vouchers
- **SWF**: $1B seed, 4% yield ($40M/year 2025 → $100M/year 2075), funds $45B budget ($750M boot camp, $44.25B vouchers).
- **Vouchers**: $32K/student—$2K/year (5–17, $26K), $4K/year (18–20, $8K), informal $4K + 2% shares.
- **Cost**: $45B/year (2075, 16.8M students).

---

- **Tech**: $400M/year ($200M broadband, $200M tools).

---

## Section 5: Workforce Integration
- **Structure**: 4M/year service (500K informal) feeds *Workforce* and *Healthcare Acts*.

---

## Section 6: Governance and Oversight
- **Regional Boards**: Subcommittees oversee vouchers, informal skills.
- **Central Oversight**: Enforces $2T debt cut.

---

## Section 7: Implementation and Milestones
- **2025**: 5M students, $50B informal seed.
- **2030**: 10M, $360B informal.
- **2055**: 15M, $480B informal, $40B productivity.
- **2075**: 16.8M, $537B informal, $50B productivity.

## Notes
- **Informal**: $200/student loans → $100B wealth (2075).
- **Risks**: 3% SWF yield delays rural hubs.
- **Synergy**: Ties to *Communications Act*’s 95% reach, *Monetary Act*’s $537B informal.

- # Bulwarkomics Legislative Acts
Legislative framework for New Crossroads, a post-revolution nation (100M, $10T GDP, 2025 → 112M, $14.5T GDP, 2075), targeting $0 debt, $537B informal economy, and 90% co-op ownership by 2075.

This repository contains the core acts driving Bulwarkomics—a debt-free, co-operative economic system. Each act builds on a unified simulation, integrating dual currency, blockchain hubs, sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), tax reforms, and governance restructuring.
